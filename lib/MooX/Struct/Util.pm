=head1 NAME

MooX::Struct::Util - extensions for MooX::Struct that would have been overkill to include

=head1 LAZY DEFAULTS

=begin trustme

=item lazy_default

=end trustme

Sugar for lazily defaulted attributes. The following two are effectively
the same.

 use MooX::Struct WebPage1 => [
    user_agent => [
       lazy     => 1,
       default  => sub { LWP::UserAgent->new },
    ],
 ];
 
 use MooX::Struct::Util qw(lazy_default);
 use MooX::Struct WebPage2 => [
    user_agent => lazy_default { LWP::UserAgent->new },
 ];
